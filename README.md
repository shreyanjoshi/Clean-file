# Clean-file
Clean any file for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and filtering profanity. 

The Clean-file project is intended to make it simple for you to correct any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and filter profanity in any file. 

Currently, if you want to use all the features, it will take approximately 3-5 seconds for one entry you want to clean.
That scales to 100 entries in 5-6 minutes.
